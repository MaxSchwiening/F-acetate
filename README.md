Face shield - laser cut from a single A4 acetate designed to attach to glasses

It is extremely light (~10g) which makes it comfortable for extended use and does not suffure from fogging. 

The design can also be manufacturer very fast we can produce a shield in 90 seconds (not including user assembly - also 90 seconds).  

The shields can be shipped and stored flat allowing for cheap and distribution.

They are heat treatable at 140<sup>o</sup>C to sterilise and reduce any potential viral load
